# UI Components & Patterns

## Library: Nuxt UI

We use **Nuxt UI** for all standard components. Refer to the Nuxt UI documentation for properties.

## Available Components (Primary)

| Component | Usage                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `UForm`   | Form wrapper with validation           |
| `UInput`  | Text, Email, and LinkedIn inputs       |
| `USelect` | Degree and Graduation Year selection   |
| `UTable`  | Displaying alumni lists in Backoffice  |
| `UButton` | Action triggers (primary, ghost, link) |
| `UModal`  | Editing alumni details                 |

## Code Pattern (Script Setup)

Always use `<script setup lang="ts">` for components.
